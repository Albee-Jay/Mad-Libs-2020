# Mad-Libs-2020
A "Mad Libs" game.

This is a MAD LIBS game I built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a project last year. It does work but could certainly use some tweaks to make it look better.

See it live here: https://albee-jay.github.io/Mad-Libs-2020/

I welcome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better.

Thank You, Albee-Jay
